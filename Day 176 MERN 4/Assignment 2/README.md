You need to create a POST route at the path "/movies" using Express.js. This route will be responsible for accepting JSON data to create a new movie in the MongoDB database and responding with the created movie. The database contains a collection of movies, each adhering to a specific schema (which is provided in the code stub). Your task is to implement the POST route so that it connects to the MongoDB database, creates a new movie record with the provided JSON data, and sends the created movie back.

Define a POST route at the path "/movies".
The POST route should accept JSON data, create a new movie in the MongoDB database, and respond with the created movie.

Set up dependencies by importing necessary libraries (express, mongoose) and ensuring Express is set up to parse JSON bodies. Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose with a specified connection string. Define the Mongoose model by creating a Movie model with a schema detailing required fields: title, description, duration, genre, language, release date, and poster. Implement a POST route at "/movies" that accepts JSON data, creates a new Movie instance, saves it to the database, and returns the created movie document. Use try-catch blocks within your route handling to catch and respond to errors.
